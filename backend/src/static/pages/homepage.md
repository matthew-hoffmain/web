# Introduction

Hello! My name is **Matthew Hoffman**. I am a law school applicant with a computer systems background. I created this 
website to showcase projects I have worked on both professionally and independently throughout the years. My goal
is to become a legal advocate for the development of rules and regulations regarding technology, information sharing,
and our digital rights.
