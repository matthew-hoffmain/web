You may have started a conversation with the AI present on this website. Prior to the release of GPT-3 (otherwise known
as the widely used Chat-GPT Language Model), I developed a chatbot using GPT-2, a much more primitive language model than
what is available today. Using a NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia_Jetson) that I had left 
over from my undergraduate capstone project, I created a single persistent storage mechanism for my conversations with 
the bot. I independently upgrade its abilities as I follow research on AI. [[2]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11903)

The bot does NOT use any external API for generating responses.
