# Frequently Asked Questions

## Q: Why law?

This is my favorite question, since I often find new reasons to answer it every day.

I have a strong belief in justice and fairness. I believe that well-designed laws can help create a more just and fair
society.

## Q: Why engineering for pre-law?

I personally believe I grew up in a very interesting time for computer technology. I was born in the late 90s, and grew up
seeing technology become more and more integrated into our daily lives. Throughout my life, I have seen policy try to
keep up.

My first phone in 2007 was a Samsung SGH-J700;
by the end of the year I had the first iPhone, *and* schools started forming policies regarding cell phone use in class.

The same year, my older brother had a MySpace account. When I got to his age, Facebook was the social media platform.
Very soon, schools and employers started forming policies regarding social media use.


At some point, I realized that **I wanted to be ahead of the curve with regards to that constant change we would see in our lives due to technology,
so that I could create informed policy**. Because of that, engineering made sense to me as a pre-law pursuit.

Now, with the rise of AI, schools are beginning to use blue books for testing to prevent cheating, yet employers are
actively encouraging the use of AI to help with work, and for once I feel like I am ahead of the curve.

## Q: What's your stance on AI?

This is an important question for me to answer, as I am positioning myself to be an expert on the subject, and I have
a chatbot on this website.
Before I answer, I want to make an important distinction:

There are **legal issues in technology**, and **technology issues in law**.

Likewise, there are **legal issues in AI**, and **AI issues in law**.
