## **Frequently Asked Questions**

###  Q: Why are certain words highlighted, and what do the colors represent?

You can hover over the [[highlighted words::Words that are visually emphasized using different colors to indicate their 
significance or category.]] on this website to see additional information about specific terms or phrases wherever I
determined they'd be useful. **You can toggle them in the [[navbar::A navbar (or navigation bar) is a graphical user 
interface element that contains links or buttons to help users navigate a website, application, or operating system. 
Typically located at the top or side of a screen, it allows users to move between different sections or pages by 
clicking on links for categories like "Home," "Products," or "Contact Us".]].** 

The colors represent different categories:
- [[Yellow highlights::Generic]] are used for **generic words and phrases**.
- {{Blue highlights::Professional}} are to indicate **proper nouns from my professional background**.
- #[Red highlights::Academic] are to indicate **proper nouns from my academic background**.
- @[Green highlights::Proper] are for **all other proper nouns**.

### Q: Where do you get the information for the highlights?

I wrote them myself using a combination of [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/), [Dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/), 
[Google AI Overview](https://search.google/ways-to-search/ai-overviews/), and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page).
In any case, they are only so accurate, and their sole purpose is to provide clarity for the context in which they are used,
rather than to serve as a primary source. @[Bryan A.  Garner::An American legal scholar and lexicographer. 
He has written more than two dozen books about English usage and style such as Garner's Modern English Usage for a 
general audience, and others for legal professionals. Garner also wrote two books with Justice Antonin Scalia: Making 
Your Case: The Art of Persuading Judges (2008) and Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts (2012). He is the 
founder and president of LawProse Inc.], in his preface to Black's Law Dictionary, 12th Edition, points out a relevant 
quote by @[Samuel Johnson::An English writer who made lasting contributions as a poet, playwright, essayist, moralist, 
literary critic, sermonist, biographer, editor, and lexicographer. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography calls him 
"arguably the most distinguished man of letters in English history".]: 

*"Dictionaries are like watches, the worst is better than none and the best cannot be expected to go quite true."*

### Q: Why is the website spelled that way (i.e. misspelled)?

The site name is a [[portmanteau::A word or part of a word made by combining the spellings and meanings of two or more other words or word parts (such as smog from smoke and fog).]] 
of my last name, "Hoffman", and "main", which in computer programming marks an entry point, or the place in a program 
where the execution of a program begins. This website serves similarly, as an introduction to me and my work.

### Q: Why do you want to study law?

If you have 30-minutes to set aside, you can read about it here. Otherwise, the main reason is that, I want to improve the world, and 
while there are many ways to improve society, I see policy and the legal system as a means of ensuring that everyone
benefits equally from those improvements. I want to contribute to that system, bringing knowledge from a professional
background in technology, a field that is rapidly changing our world.

### Q: When did you decide to pursue a law career?

I dedicated myself towards a career in law as early as high school. Despite currently working as a software engineer, 
I planned on gaining professional experience in STEM prior to law school in order to build a unique skillset as a future 
attorney.

### Q: Why not choose another major if you were determined to attend law school?

This question mostly comes from peers in STEM. It's a common misconception that you need an undergraduate
degree in a humanities field (Political science, History, English, etc.). While these

The other reason of non-zero importance is that, if I ever decided **not** to attend law school, then I would have
a pretty solid fallback plan.

### Q: Being a successful engineer does not necessarily mean you will be a successful lawyer. What makes you believe you will be a successful lawyer?

I don't think that there's any answer more sufficient than to say that I have the ability to develop the necessary skills to 
become successful, if I don't already have them, and that I have an incredible passion for the law that will propel me through the effort
of developing those skills through education. No one can provide indisputable proof of their future success, but I can
definitely argue for it!

### Q: Are you interested in legal fields outside intellectual property and technology?

Yes, absolutely! 

### Q: What's your stance on AI?

This is an important question for me to answer, as I am positioning myself to be an expert on the subject, and I have
a chatbot on this website.

This question usually comes as an academic inquiry, since the usage of generative AI in higher education has become
so prevalent.

Before I answer, I want to make an important distinction:

There are **legal issues in technology**, and **technology issues in law**.

Likewise, there are **legal issues in AI**, and **AI issues in law**.
